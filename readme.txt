I ran the code on intelliJ so it has built in Node.js compabilities. All you have to do is it run on the 
server.js file and choose the path as node.exe file. Then you go to google and go to http://localhost:3000/
then you get a list of the calculators. You can choose any calculator and it should work as expected.
